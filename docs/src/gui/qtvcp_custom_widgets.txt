= QTvcp Building Custom Widgets

Building custom widgets allows one to use the Qt Designer editor to place +
a custom widget rather then doing it manually in a handler file. +
A useful custom widgets would be a great way to contribute back to linuxcnc. +

== Widgets

Widget is the general name for the UI objects such as buttons and labels in pyQT. +
There are also special widgets made for linuxcnc that make integration easier. +
This widgets can be placed with qt Designer editor - allowing one to see the result +
before actually loading the panel in linuxcnc. +

== Designer
Qt Designer is a What You See is What You Get editor for placing pyQT widgets. +
It's original intend was for building the graphic widgets for programs. +
We leverage it to build screens and panels for linuxcnc. +
In Qt Designer linuxcnc widgets are split in three heading on the left side of the editor. +
One is for HAL only widgets. +
One is for Linuxcnc controller widgets +
And one is for dialog widgets. +
 +
For Designer to add custom widgets to it's editor it must have a plugin added to the right folder. +

=== Custom Hal Widgets
Hal widgets are the simplest to show example of. +
qtvcp/widgets/simple_widgets.py holds many HAL only widgets. +
Lets look at a snippet of simple_widgets.py. +

# Imports
###############################
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
from qtvcp.widgets.widget_baseclass import _HalWidgetBase, _HalSensitiveBase
import hal

######################
# WIDGET
######################

class Lcnc_GridLayout(QtWidgets.QWidget, _HalSensitiveBase):
    def __init__(self, parent = None):
        super(GridLayout, self).__init__(parent)
----

=== In the 'Imports' section

This is where we import libraries that our widget class needs. +
In this case we need access to pyqt's QtWidgets library, linuxcnc's hal library +
and qtvcp's widget baseclass _HalSensitiveBase for automatic HAL pin setup. +

=== In the 'WIDGET' section
Ok here is our custom widget based on pyQT's QGridLaayout widget. +
grid layout allows one to place objects in a grid fashion. +
But this grid_layout also will enable and disable all widgets inside it +
based on the state of a HAL pin. +
Line by Line: +
[source,python]
----
class Lcnc_GridLayout(QtWidgets.QWidget, _HalSensitiveBase): +
----
This defines the class name and the libraries in inherits from. +
this class named Lcnc_GridLayout inheriets the functions of QWidget and _HalSensitiveBase. +
_HalSensitiveBase is 'subclass' of _HalWidgetBase, The base class of most Qtvcp widgets +
meaning it has all the functions of _HalWidgetBase plus the functions of _HalSensitiveBase. +
It adds the function to make the widget be enabled or disabled based on a HAL input BIT pin. +
[source,python]
----
def __init__(self, parent = None): +
----
This is the function called when the widget is first made (said instantiated)- this is pretty standard. +
[source,python]
----
super(GridLayout, self).__init__(parent) +
----
This function initializes our widget's 'Super' classes. +
'Super' just means the inherited baseclasses; QWidget and _HalSensitiveBase +
Pretty standard other the the widget name will change +

=== Custom Controller Widgets
Widget that interact with linuxcnc's controller are only a little more complicated +
they require some extra libraries. +
In this cut down example we will add properties that can be changed in Designer. +
This LED indicator widget will respond to selectable linuxcnc controller states. +

    is_on_status = pyqtProperty(bool, get_is_on, set_is_on, reset_is_on)
----

=== In the 'Imports' section

This is where we import libraries that our widget class needs. +
We import pyqtProperty so we can interact with the Designer editor. +
we import LED because our custom widget is based on it. +
We import Status because it gives us status messages from linuxcnc. +

=== In the 'Instantiate Libraries' section
Typically we instantiated the libraries outside of the widget class so that the +
reference to it is global - meaning you don't need to use self. in front of it. +
By convention we use all capital letters in the name. +

=== In the 'custom widget class definition' section
This is the meat and potatoes of our custom widget. +
[source,python]
----
class StateLed(LED):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super(StateLed, self).__init__(parent)
        self.has_hal_pins = False
        self.setState(False)
        self.is_estopped = False
        self.is_on = False
        self.invert_state = False
----
This defines the name of our custom widget and what other class it inherits from, in this case +
we inherit LED - a Qtvcp widget that represents a status light. +
The __init__ is typical of most widgets, it is called when the widget is first made. +
the super line is typical of most widgets - it calls the parent (super) widget's initialization code. +
then we set some attributes. +
self.has_hal_pins is an attribute inherited from Lcnc_Led - we set it here so no HAL Pins are made. +
self.setState is inherited from Lcnc_led - we set it to make sure the LED is off. +
the other attributes are for the selectable options of our widget. +
[source,python]
----
    def _hal_init(self):
        if self.is_estopped:
            STATUS.connect('state-estop', lambda w:self._flip_state(True))
            STATUS.connect('state-estop-reset', lambda w:self._flip_state(False))
        elif self.is_on:
            STATUS.connect('state-on', lambda w:self._flip_state(True))
            STATUS.connect('state-off', lambda w:self._flip_state(False))
----
This function connects STATUS (linuxcnc status message library) to our widget so that the LED will on or off based on +
the selected state of the controller. We have two states we can choose from is_estopped or is_on +
Depending on which is active our widget get connected to the appropriate STATUS messages. +
_hal_int() is called on each widget that inherited _HalWidgetBase, when Qtvcp first builds the screen. +
You might wonder why it's called on this widget since we didn't have _HalWidgetBase in our class +
definition (class Lcnc_State_Led(Lcnc_Led):) - it's called because Lcnc_Led inherits  _HalWidgetBase +
 +
in this function you have access to some extra information. (though we don't use them in this example) +
[source,python]
----
        self.HAL_GCOMP = the HAL component instance
        self.HAL_NAME = This widgets name as a string
        self.QT_OBJECT_ = This widgets pyQt object instance
        self.QTVCP_INSTANCE_ = The very toplevel Parent Of the screen
        self.PATHS_ = The instance of Qtvcp's path library
        self.PREFS_ = the isnstance of an optional preference file
----
We could use this information to create HAL pins or look up image paths etc. +
[source,python]
----
            STATUS.connect('state-estop', lambda w:self._flip_state(True))
----
lets look at this line more closely. STATUS is very common theme is widget building. +
STATUS use GObject message system to send messages to widgets that register to it. +
This line is the register process. +
'state-estop' is the message we wish to act on. there are many messages available. +
'lambda w:self._flip_state(True)' is what happens when the message is caught. +
the lambda function accepts the widget instance (w) that GObject sends it and then calls the function +
self._flip_state(True) +
Lambda was used to strip the (w) object before calling the self._flip_state function. +
It also allowed use to send self._flip_state() the True state. +

[source,python]
----
    def _flip_state(self, data):
            if self.invert_state:
                data = not data
            self.change_state(data)
----
This is the function that actually flips the state of the LED. +
It is what gets called when the appropriate STATUS message is accepted. +
 +
You will also see code like this (no lambda):
[source,python]
----
STATUS.connect('current-feed-rate', self._set_feedrate_text)
----
and the function called looks like this:
[source,python]
----
    def _set_feedrate_text(self, widget, data):
----
in which the widget and any data must be accepted by the function. +

=== In the  'Designer properties setter/getters/resetters' section
This is how Designer sets the attributes of the widget. +
thes can also be called directly in the widget. +

=== In the 'Designer properties' section
This is the registering of properties in Designer. +
The property name is the text that is used in Designer. +
These property names cannot be the same as the attributes they represent. +
These properties show in Designer in the order they appear here. +

== Widget Plugins
We must register our custom widget for Designer to use them. +
Here is a typical sample +
It would need to be added to qtvcp/plugins/ +
Then qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py would need to be adjusted +
to import it. +
